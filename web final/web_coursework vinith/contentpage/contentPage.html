                The objective of ensuring energy access and equity is to ensure fair distribution and universal availability of energy resources, particularly in underserved communities.
                This involves implementing laws and initiatives to ensure that everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographical location, has access to reliable energy sources.
                This encompasses the deployment of renewable energy solutions, enhancement of energy infrastructure, and facilitation of affordable financing options.
                By addressing disparities in energy access, it promotes social justice, economic development, and environmental sustainability, fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.
                Moreover, developing inclusive energy policies and initiatives that cater to the diverse needs of populations and empower individuals and communities to actively participate in the energy transition relies on forging partnerships between the public and private sectors, as well as local communities.
